# Transform-your-Business-with-the-Cloud-ERP-Procure-to-pay-Software
Digital procurement software is the new digital solution to streamlining and automating the procure-to-pay business process. Handling each step of the process, Procure-to-Pay software solutions allow you to automatically raise, process and archive all purchase requests (PR), purchase orders (PO), invoices, payment receipts and all related approval documents. There is a common misconception though, that procurement software is a costly option, only possible for large companies â€“ this is not true at all with cloud-based procurement software, where you pay a small subscription fee for a full suite of software! The TYASuite Procurement to Pay Software Solutions is the most affordable, scalable and flexible option for transforming your procurement to pay process from manual to digital and automated. Featuring an interactive dashboard, a master database, robust reporting tools, convenient alerts and notifications and a secure cloud hosted by AWS, the TYASuite plug and play procurement module gives you a unified and integrated platform to manage your entire procurement cycle with ease and efficiency.
